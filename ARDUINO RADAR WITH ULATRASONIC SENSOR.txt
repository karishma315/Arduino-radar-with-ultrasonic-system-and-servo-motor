ARDUINO RADAR WITH ULATRASONIC SENSOR AND SERVO MOTOR 

This project is a "DIY Radar System* made using an *HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor" and a "servo motor" with an "Arduino UNO". The servo rotates the sensor, and the Arduino calculates the distance to nearby objects.


COMPONENTS USED:
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
- Servo Motor (SG90 or equivalent)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or direct connections


 HOW IT WORKS:
1. The servo motor continuously rotates the ultrasonic sensor left and right.
2. The HC-SR04 emits sound waves and measures how long it takes for the echo to return.
3. Arduino calculates the distance and shows it on the serial monitor or a radar UI.


 Circuit Connections:
 HC-SR04:
- VCC → 5V (Arduino)
- GND → GND
- Trig → Digital Pin 9
- Echo → Digital Pin 10

 Servo Motor:
- VCC (Red) → 5V
- GND (Black) → GND
- Signal (Yellow) → Digital Pin 11
